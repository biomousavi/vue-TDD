# Vue 3 TDD playground

- Test Driven Development by using Vue, Vite and Vitest.



##### notes:

- have single assertion (expect) in your tests
  it helps us to be more specific and have more scalable tests

- msw is a mocking server that allows us to use any library in client side and handle them on our test units

- shallow mount: allows you to render a component without rendering the child components
